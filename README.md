# Msc_Degree_Grader
Task (PART A) 

This Java program simulates the Module Grading in the "York grading project" 

The program takes marks (e.g. 65) as parameter and returns a grade (e.g. “Good”).

It can also prompt the user for input from the keyboard and validate a mark in the range until a valid input has been taken.
